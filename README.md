## Theme: Brenchmark Dijkstra Algorithm

## Approach

#### Algorithm Description
Dijkstra's algorithm  is an algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph, which may represent, for example, road networks. It was conceived by computer scientist Edsger W. Dijkstra in 1956 and published three years later.

For a given source node in the graph, the algorithm finds the shortest path between that node and every other. It can also be used for finding the shortest paths from a single node to a single destination node by stopping the algorithm once the shortest path to the destination node has been determined. 

#### Target Languages

| Languages     | Description     | 
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
| C++           | general-purpose programming language which imperative, object-oriented and generic programming features, while also providing facilities for low-level memory manipulation| 
| C             | low-level imperative computer programming language, supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope and recursion |  
| Java          | general-purpose programming language that is class-based, object-oriented, and specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible |    
| Python        | interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language.      |   
| Javascript    | lightweight, interpreted, object-oriented language with first-class functions, and is best known as the scripting language for Web pages |  
| Ruby          | dynamic, interpreted, reflective, object-oriented, general-purpose programming language      |
